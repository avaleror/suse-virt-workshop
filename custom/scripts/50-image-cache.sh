# suse-virt-workshop custom_scripts step 1/3.
#
# Downloads and caches a small, freely redistributable cloud image, then
# serves it over HTTP on the libvirt NAT gateway (192.168.122.1) so
# harvester1-3 can import it as a VirtualMachineImage without any external
# network dependency at exercise time — the same role Exercise 2.7's manual
# image upload plays, done once at deploy time instead of by hand.
#
# WHY THIS IMAGE: suse-virt-rodeo's own equivalent (SLES15-SP7-Minimal-VM) is
# gated behind SUSE Customer Center — dl.suse.com URLs are signed and expire,
# so there is no way to auto-download it on a self-hosted deploy with no SCC
# registration. openSUSE Leap 16.0's KVM appliance is the closest freely
# downloadable equivalent: same small-cloud-image shape (~308 MiB download),
# no registration, stable distribution URL.
#
# Idempotent: skips the download if the file is already present and its
# checksum matches — safe to re-run on every `rodeo up` (this is a
# no_cache_phase). The checksum itself is fetched fresh each run rather than
# hardcoded, so a future openSUSE rebuild under the same filename doesn't
# require updating this script.
