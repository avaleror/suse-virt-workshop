# Exercise 2 (The Subterranean Divide) self-check — verifies 2.2 and 2.4.
# 2.1 and 2.3 are pure UI inspection, 2.5/2.6/2.7/2.8 have no fixed
# expected values to check against (network/SSH key/image name/user-data
# are all "whatever you set up" by design) — nothing to verify for those.
#
# Adapted from suse-virt-rodeo's own Instruqt check for this chapter
# (02-the-subterranean-divide-cluster-prep/check-kvm-host) — same checks,
# same names (this workshop's namespaces and StorageClass match the rodeo's
# exactly), just pointed at this workshop's kubeconfig path.
#
# Run from the KVM/EC2 host:
#   ./checks/check-exercise-2.sh
